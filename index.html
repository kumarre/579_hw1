            <p>Iâ€™m a self-driven UX designer who is passionate 
                about self-development, social good, education, 
                consumer health tech, and understanding cultures 
                outside of my own. I'm particularly interested 
                in understanding how psychology influences design 
                and how good design can influence the thoughts, 
                actions, motivations, and emotions of a user.</p>
